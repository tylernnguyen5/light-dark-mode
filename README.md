# Light Dark Mode 

This is a project where I worked with light theme and dark theme. It comes with a toggle switch located in the upper right corner to switch between the two themes.
Between themes, the font color, background, images and icons are changed accordingly. 

It also works with the `document.LocalStorage` to store the last theme value that the user chose when he/she last visited the website. Navigation bar is provided to smooth scroll to specific pages.
